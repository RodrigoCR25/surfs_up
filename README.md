# surfs_up

In the elaboration of this challenge, it was possible to visualize the statistics in a general way of the temperature of June and December.

It is worth mentioning that the results obtained between June and December regarding the average temperature are not very variable, what we mean with this comment is that during these months it is expected to have a similar temperature throughout the year.
Now mentioning the temperature in Hawaii, it will not be extremely low, which means that during the month of December we can expect tourists to come to enjoy perfect waves to be able to do surfing.

As part of this analysis and taking into account that these dates are off for most people, we would like to know from a marketing perspective if it is possible to develop surf events, so that hotels, sports stores and local businesses have more income. thanks to the development of a surf event.
As part of a second statistics, for this type of ideas it would be of great help to know the capacity of the city to receive such a demand and to be able to prepare investment projects for the growth in demand.
